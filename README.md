# ragtime_extension
As of right now, we have an extension button in the upper right corner
(Icon is a placeholder; I don't intend for us to use the poorly drawn smiley face!)
Clicking the button creates a fixed img over the browser screen with a gif of a film with scratches and dust rolling.
Opacity and sepia effects are added to see underneath with an old-timey feel.
Pointer events is set to none on the image so you can click underneath the gif as if it weren't there!

Problems:
Need to desaturate other elements without it taking ridiculously long to load.
Need to lower resolution on gif, or something so that runtime is up to speed. (Right now it slows down considerably)
